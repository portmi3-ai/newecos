## Key External Documentation & Directories

To ensure our meta agent platform remains at the forefront of best practices, extensibility, and integration, we reference the following external documentation and directories:

- **Awesome MCP Servers (GitHub, mcpservers.org):** Curated, up-to-date lists of the best MCP servers for every use case. Essential for discovering new capabilities and staying current with the ecosystem.
- **Official Anthropic MCP Server Repository:** The canonical source for protocol-compliant, well-maintained server implementations.
- **Meta-Directories (MCP.so, Smithery, PulseMCP, Glama, Cursor Directory):** Aggregators that index thousands of MCP servers, making it easy to find, compare, and install the best tools for any workflow.
- **Hugging Face Community Guides:** In-depth articles and tutorials on server setup, FastAPI/Gradio integration, and client configuration. These guides provide actionable, step-by-step instructions and best practices.
- **Security Best Practices (awesome-mcp-security):** Reference for secret management, access control, and compliance in MCP integrations.
- **Community Hubs (Reddit r/MCP, MCPshare):** For news, new server announcements, and integration tips from the broader MCP community.

**These resources are critical for ongoing platform evolution, rapid integration of new agent capabilities, and maintaining a secure, robust, and future-proof architecture.**
