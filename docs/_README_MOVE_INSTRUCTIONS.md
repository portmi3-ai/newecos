# Documentation Consolidation Plan

To improve navigation and organization, all major documentation files and folders are being moved into the `docs/` directory. This includes:

## Folders to Move
- `career-development/resumes/`
- `career-development/project-docs/`
- `career-development/personal-branding/`
- `career-development/implementation/`
- `career-development/ai-projects/NeuroCursor/`
- `agentecos-main/docs/`

## File Types to Move
- All `.md` (Markdown) files from the project root and subdirectories
- Project overviews, business plans, technical docs, guides, and reference materials

## Purpose
- Centralize all documentation for easy access
- Improve onboarding and navigation for new team members
- No impact on code execution or deployment

**After moving, update any links or references to these files in the codebase or documentation.**
