### Brand Story
"Throughout my 30-year career, I've consistently transformed business challenges into opportunities for growth and improvement. From my early days at Verizon developing enterprise B2B solutions to my leadership roles at financial institutions like Fifth Third Bank and Comerica, I've always focused on aligning operational excellence with strategic business objectives.

My journey has taught me that true security isn't about saying 'no' – it's about finding secure ways to say 'yes' to business initiatives. When I led branch-wide initiatives at Fifth Third Bank, resulting in a 20% revenue increase, I did so while simultaneously strengthening compliance operations and ensuring adherence to industry regulations.

Today, I'm passionate about bringing this business-focused approach to security leadership. In an era where security threats are constantly evolving, organizations need leaders who understand both the technical aspects of security and the business impact of security decisions. That's the perspective I bring to every conversation and initiative."
