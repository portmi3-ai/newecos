On October 6, 2024, I, Michael Porter, along with Katey Carrier from the Alzheimer’s Association and Sara Lafountain from Edward Jones, organized the "Walk for Friends" event at Squirrel Hollow Run Golf Course in Battle Creek, MI. This initiative aimed to raise awareness and support for individuals and families affected by Alzheimer’s disease.

The event brought together friends, family members, and community supporters to participate in a meaningful walk, fostering connections and offering a platform for sharing experiences. We collaborated with local businesses and organizations to secure sponsorships and donations, which helped cover event costs and contributed to the Alzheimer’s Association’s mission.

Throughout the planning process, we focused on community engagement, participant experience, and fundraising efforts. Our team worked diligently to promote the event through social media, local press, and community outreach, resulting in a successful turnout and significant donations for Alzheimer’s research and support services. The event not only raised funds but also provided a supportive environment for those impacted by the disease, highlighting the importance of community in facing such challenges.On October 6, 2024, I, Michael Porter, along with Katey Carrier from the Alzheimer’s Association and Sara Lafountain from Edward Jones, organized the "Walk for Friends" event at Squirrel Hollow Run Golf Course in Battle Creek, MI.
