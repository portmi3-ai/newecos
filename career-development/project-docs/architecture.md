- Temporary file storage with automatic deletion
- No persistent storage of user resumes
- HTTPS for all communications
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Performance Optimization
- Client-side resume parsing when possible
- Asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
- Progress updates via WebSockets
- Caching of job description analysis for similar URLs

## Scalability Considerations
- Stateless architecture for horizontal scaling
- Serverless functions for processing tasks
- CDN for static assets
- Queue system for handling high load

## Future Enhancements
